          Service. We may also send you Service-related emails or messages

          Service and our communications and messaging to you and to others in

          to invite a friend to join FoodFeed, we may send an email invitation
          to that friend that includes a photo of you (to let them know you are
          the person extending the invitation) as well as a photo of one or more
          other users that we believe may know the same friend. Similarly, we
          may include your photo in invitations sent by other FoodFeed users to
          recipients we think may know you. We may also use information about
          you and your activities on the Service, including your photo, to
          provide personalized content, including targeted content and
          advertising on our site as well as on other sites and services,
          including on Facebook. We use data to help make the advertisements we
          show more relevant to you and to others, but we do not use your
          content in your email, chat, or video calls to target ads to you. By
          using our Service you agree that we may use your information to
          customize your content and provide you with more targeted advertising,
          as well as to customize the content and promotional messaging we send
          to others. If you choose not to provide personal data, we may not be

          Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and others. These companies have
          interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct
          advertisements to users who have shown interest in our Service while
          those users are on the social media platform, or to groups of other
          users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests
          and demographics. These advertisements are governed by the privacy
          policies of those social media companies that provide them. For
          example, we may work with Facebook to display interest-based ads to
          you or to your friends on Facebook through a tool offered by Facebook
          called the Custom Audience Tool. This tool allows us to personalize
          our ads based on you or your friends’ experience on our Service in
          order to provide ads tailored for each specific recipient. We do not
          share personal information about your activities on our Service with
          Facebook, but we share a hashed email address or phone number which
          permits Facebook to identify our advertising audience based on the
          information that Facebook collects from its users. If you do not want
          to receive interest-based ads on Facebook, you can adjust your ad
          preferences through your Facebook settings. If you do not want us to
          use your content to personalize advertising that we direct to your
          friends on Facebook, you may email us at privacy@buzzwordlabs.com
          Cross-Device Linking We, or our third party partners, may link your
          various devices so that content you see on one device can result in
          relevant advertising on another device. We do this by collecting
          information about each device you use when you are logged in to our
          Service. We may also work with third party partners who employ
          tracking technologies, or the application of statistical modeling
          tools, to determine if two or more devices are linked to a single user
          or household. We may share a common account identifier (such as an
          email address or user ID) with third party advertising partners to
          help recognize you across devices. We, and our partners, can use this
          cross-device linkage to serve interest-based advertising and other
          personalized content to you across your devices, to perform analytics
          and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns. Your
          choices: Interest-based advertising. To learn about interest-based
          advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this
          advertising, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising
          Initiative’s online resources, at
          http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices, and/or the DAA’s resources

          opting-out of receiving interest-based advertising through the NAI’s
          and DAA’s online resources will only opt-out a user from receiving
          interest-based ads on that specific browser or device, but the user
          may still receive interest-based ads on his or her other devices. You
          must perform the opt-out on each browser or device you use. Mobile
          advertising You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising
          through the settings on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad
          tracking” (iOS) or “opt-out of interest based ads” (Android). You may
          also be able to opt-out of some – but not all – interest-based ads
          served by mobile ad networks by visiting
          http://youradchoices.com/appchoices and downloading the mobile
          AppChoices app. Some of these opt-outs may not be effective unless
          your browser is set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, change
          your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another
          operating system, you will need to opt-out again. Google Analytics and
          Advertising We may also utilize certain forms of display advertising
          and other advanced features through Google Analytics, such as
          Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression
          Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google
          Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. These features enable
          us to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie)
          and third-party cookies (such as the Doubleclick advertising cookie)
          or other third party cookies together to inform, optimize, and display
          ads based on your past visits to the Service. You may control your
          advertising preferences or opt-out of certain Google advertising
          products by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently
          available at https://google.com/ads/preferences or by vising NAI’s
          online resources at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices .
