These companies have\n          interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct\n          advertisements to users who have shown interest in our Service while\n          those users are on the social media platform, or to groups of other\n          users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests\n          and demographics. These advertisements are governed by the privacy\n          policies of those social media companies that provide them. For\n          example, we may work with Facebook to display interest-based ads to\n          you or to your friends on Facebook through a tool offered by Facebook\n          called the Custom Audience Tool. This tool allows us to personalize\n          our ads based on you or your friends’ experience on our Service in\n          order to provide ads tailored for each specific recipient. We do not\n          share personal information about your activities on our Service with\n          Facebook, but we share a hashed email address or phone number which\n          permits Facebook to identify our advertising audience based on the\n          information that Facebook collects from its users. If you do not want\n          to receive interest-based ads on Facebook, you can adjust your ad\n          preferences through your Facebook settings. If you do not want us to\n          use your content to personalize advertising that we direct to your\n          friends on Facebook, you may email us at privacy@buzzwordlabs.com\n          Cross-Device Linking We, or our third party partners, may link your\n          various devices so that content you see on one device can result in\n          relevant advertising on another device. We do this by collecting\n          information about each device you use when you are logged in to our\n          Service. We may also work with third party partners who employ\n          tracking technologies, or the application of statistical modeling\n          tools, to determine if two or more devices are linked to a single user\n          or household. We may share a common account identifier (such as an\n          email address or user ID) with third party advertising partners to\n          help recognize you across devices. We, and our partners, can use this\n          cross-device linkage to serve interest-based advertising and other\n          personalized content to you across your devices, to perform analytics\n          and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns. Your\n          choices: Interest-based advertising. To learn about interest-based\n          advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this\n          advertising, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising\n          Initiative’s online resources, at\n          http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices, and/or the DAA’s resources\n          at www.aboutads.info/choices. You may also manage certain advertising\n          cookies by visiting the EU-based Your Online Choices at\n          www.youronlinechoices.eu Cross-device linking. Please note that\n          opting-out of receiving interest-based advertising through the NAI’s\n          and DAA’s online resources will only opt-out a user from receiving\n          interest-based ads on that specific browser or device, but the user\n          may still receive interest-based ads on his or her other devices. You\n          must perform the opt-out on each browser or device you use. Mobile\n          advertising You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising\n          through the settings on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad\n          tracking” (iOS) or “opt-out of interest based ads” (Android). You may\n          also be able to opt-out of some – but not all – interest-based ads\n          served by mobile ad networks by visiting\n          http://youradchoices.com/appchoices and downloading the mobile\n          AppChoices app. Some of these opt-outs may not be effective unless\n          your browser is set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, change\n          your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another\n          operating system, you will need to opt-out again. Google Analytics and\n          Advertising We may also utilize certain forms of display advertising\n          and other advanced features through Google Analytics, such as\n          Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression\n          Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google\n          Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. These features enable\n          us to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie)\n          and third-party cookies (such as the Doubleclick advertising cookie)\n          or other third party cookies together to inform, optimize, and display\n          ads based on your past visits to the Service. You may control your\n          advertising preferences or opt-out of certain Google advertising\n          products by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently\n          available at https://google.com/ads/preferences or by vising NAI’s\n          online resources at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices .\n          Security and storage of information Buzzword Labs cares about the\n          security of your information and uses commercially reasonable\n          physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve the\n          integrity and security of all information we collect and that we share\n          with our service providers.

Additional Terms for Mobile\n          Applications Mobile Applications We may make available software to\n          access the Service via a mobile device (“Mobile Applications”).

You may use mobile data in connection with the Mobile\n          Applications and may incur additional charges from your wireless\n          provider for these services. You agree that you are solely responsible\n          for any such charges. Buzzword Labs hereby grants you a non-exclusive,\n          non- transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code copy of\n          the Mobile Applications for one Buzzword Labs User Account on one\n          mobile device owned or leased solely by you, for your personal use.\n          You may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer\n          the Mobile Applications, except to the extent that such restriction is\n          expressly prohibited by law; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell,\n          sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Mobile Applications\n          to any third party or use the Mobile Applications to provide time\n          sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii) make any copies\n          of the Mobile Applications; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage\n          or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Mobile\n          Applications, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any\n          content accessible through the Mobile Applications, or features that\n          enforce limitations on use of the Mobile Applications; or (v) delete\n          the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the Mobile\n          Applications. You acknowledge that Buzzword Labs may from time to time\n          issue upgraded versions of the Mobile Applications, and may\n          automatically electronically upgrade the version of the Mobile\n          Applications that you are using on your mobile device. You consent to\n          such automatic upgrading on your mobile device, and agree that the\n          terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to all such\n          upgrades. Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the Mobile\n          Applications is covered by the applicable open source or third-party\n          license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. The foregoing\n          license grant is not a sale of the Mobile Applications or any copy\n          thereof, and Buzzword Labs or its third-party partners or suppliers\n          retain all right, title, and interest in the Mobile Applications (and\n          any copy thereof).

Any use, reproduction, release,\n          performance, display or disclosure of the Service and any accompanying\n          documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by these\n          Terms of Service and is prohibited except to the extent expressly\n          permitted by these Terms of Service.
